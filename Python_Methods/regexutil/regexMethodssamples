-----------------------RegEx Metacharacters------------------------------------------
 Metacharacters are the characters to be used for making the search pattern
Character           Format         Description
\                   "\a"           Indicate special sequence and skaps characters
.                   "Wo..d"        Catch any character
[]                 "[a-zA-Z]"     Set of characters
()                                 Capture and group
{}                 "Wo{5}"         Exactly the specified numbers of occurance
|                  "a|A"           OR, Either
*                  "Wor*"          Zero or more occurrences
+                 "Wor+"           One or more occurrences
^                 "^Hello"        Start With
$                 "World$"         Ends With
------------------------Special Sequences--------------------
To define a special sequence user must add backslash(\) followed by special character
Note: 1. In this table the upper letters are mainly the negation of the lower letters
Note: 2. The r in the beginning of some special characters , is to make sure that the string  which is passed to the function is a raw string

\A            "\AThe"                    Returns match with the specified characters located at the the beginning of the string
\b            r"\bHell" and r"rld\b"     Returns match with the specified characters located at the beginning or at the end of a word,according to its position
\B            r"\BHell" and r"rid\B      Returns match with the specified characters which are not located at the beginning or at the end of a  word, according to its position
\d            \d                         Returns match where the string contains digit
\D            \D                         Returns match where the string does not contain digit
\s            "\s"                       Return match where the string contains a white space character
\S            "\S"                       Returns match where the string does not contain a white space charactes
\w           "\w"                        Returns match where the string contains any word characters
\W            "\W"                       Returns match where the string does not contain any word characters
\Z           "World\Z"                   Returns match with the specified characters at the end of the string

-----------------------------------------RegEx Functions------------------------------------------------
There are some built-in functions in re module which enable users to search a string for a pattern
Function              Description
findall()             Returns a list of all matches
search()              Returns a match object
split()               Returns a list of splitted string at each match
sub()                Replace matches

-----------------------------------Match Object Methods---------------------------------------
Match object provides  information about the search and result. Basically , match object has methods and properties which are accessable by programmers
and are used to get the information about the search and result
Method                   Description
group()                  Returns the part of the string where there was a match
string                   Returns the string passed into the function
span()                   Returns a tuple containing the start-, and end positions of the match
