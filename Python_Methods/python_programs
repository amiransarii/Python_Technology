1. Given two unsorted arrays arr1[] and arr2[]. They may contain duplicates.
    For each element in arr1[] count elements less than or equal to it in array arr2[].
#The purpose of Bisect algorithm is to find a position in list where an element needs to be inserted to keep the list sorted.
#Python in its definition provides the bisect algorithms using the module “bisect”
 which allows to keep the list in sorted order after insertion of each elemen
import bisect as bt
class Solution:
    def countEleLessThanOrEqual(self,arr1,n1,arr2,n2):
        arr2.sort()
        res = []
        for e in arr1:
            res.append(bt.bisect(arr2,e))
        return res
