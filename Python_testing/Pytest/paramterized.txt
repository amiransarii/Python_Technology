Fixtures: Function that are run by pytest before(and sometimes after) the actual test functions
Eg.Setup DB Connection, or initialize webdriver
Can put fixturs in individual test files or in confest.py for making fixtues available in multiple 
test files 

Fixture Basics

conftest.py: -> Share fixturs across multiple tests.
Can have single confest.py in centalized directory for all
test to access the fixtues.

Also can have other conftest.py files in subdirectories
It should not be imported by test files

conftest.py is python module. no need imported by test files

pytest -v -k test_fixtures03 --setup-show
M setup01 -> Module run first
F setup02 -> Run After Module 


The "Factory as Fixture" pattern can help in situations where the result of a fixture is needed
multiple times in a single test. Instead of returning data directly, the fixture 
instead returns a function which generates the data. This function can be then called
multiple times in test.
